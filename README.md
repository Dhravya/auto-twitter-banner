### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/Dhravya/auto-twitter-banner.git
cd auto-twitter-banner
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

First, you need your developer tokens from twitter:
- Go to https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/
- Create an app, and get your keys and tokens 
- Make a `.env` file and fill it up according to `.env.example`
- Go to your app settings -> User authentication settings -> Toggle on OAuth 1.0a, and in the OAuth 1.0a Settings section, select Read and write

Make sure it says read and write access here, something like this

You might need to make your own banner and figure out the position where you need to paste the images and just change the `FIRST_IMAGE_COORDS` and `IMAGE_DIA` constants

```
python main.py
```
